# 365-Data-Science-Challenge

## A Neural Network model using Keras to predict whether a Free Plan user would convert to a paid subscriber or not:

Add calculated columns per student before merging all needed data into one data frame.
Dropp unneeded data and drop all very low correlated features with the y variable column.
Use Stratified Random Sampling based on the highest correlated features with the y variable data.
Use StandardScaler to strandardize X values.
Create neural network model using Keras.
Get Loss and Accuracy as below:
 - Training: loss: 0.0633 - accuracy: 0.9841
 - Validation: val_loss: 0.0630 - val_accuracy: 0.9840
 - Test: loss: 0.0689 - accuracy: 0.9826
